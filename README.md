**Goals:**  

Apply clustering algorithms to multiple time series (TS):
- A list of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (~100)
    - 30 days of closing prices
    - 3 days hourly close prices
    - 1 hour minute close prices
- Compare KNN (or similar) and DTW approaches;
- Try TS clustering after automatic feature generation with TSFEL;
- Analyze composition of clusters without Bitcoin.

**Additional goals:**  

- Build risk profile for CC portfolios from one cluster and from
different clusters;
- Apply MatrixProfile methods (from Skimpy library) to find
repeated motifs and discords (anomalies) on cryptocurrencies (CC) from
various clusters.


**Means:**  

All preprocessing and pipelines management will be done in ATOM.

**Data:**  

- CC prices will be downloaded with [cryptocompare](https://github.com/lagerfeuer/cryptocompare) library.
